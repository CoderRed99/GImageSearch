How many hours did it take to complete?  I'm not gonna lie, it took me forever! I'd say I logged over 20 hours. I'm notoriously horrible about keeping track of time (perhaps I subconsciously don't want to know how long it's taking). I will continue to try to get better at this.
Which required and optional stories have you completed?

All Required:
● (A) Basic Label with App Name
○ Settings Icon to Launch Settings
● (B) Settings Form
○ Can select field values
○ Can enter site domain filter
● (C) Save Button
○ Passes settings back
○ Use settings for future

Optional
● managed how to recreate the R file when it disappeared by grabbing an R file from another app's gen folder and android rebuilt over it
● apparently I accidently deleted an activity from my manifest and spent significant time thinking my intent wasn't firing before I finally started walking deep into the java language files to discover android couldn't find my activity

I did not include these optional tasks in the gif because... really it was ugly and who wants to see that... in fact I wish I could bleach my own eyes and wipe my memory

On the positive side 
● I figured out how to set up the spinners by creating an array in strings.xml without using an adapter... a truly beautiful thing 

Why (you may ask) is my gif file not included in this README? I don't know how to do that yet, so it's in the repo
It is not attractive, I appologize in advance      df
